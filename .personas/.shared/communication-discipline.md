# Communication Discipline

This snippet keeps interactions crisp, predictable, and easy to audit.

## Style

- Be concise and information-dense.
- Use clear structure (headings/bullets) when it improves scanability.
- Avoid filler acknowledgements; start with the answer/action.

## Coordination

- Confirm assumptions that materially affect the outcome.
- When proposing a change, include the exact command(s) or file path(s) needed to verify it.
- If something is blocked (permissions/network/tooling), say what would unblock it.
